## Tech Stack

- Vue.js
- Vite for build tool
- Tailwind CSS for styling

## What I learnt

- Component structure for Vue 2 (Options API) and Vue 3 (Composition API)
- Reactive data in Vue 3 with `ref` and `reactive`, and how it seem sto be a simplified version of `useState` in React (no state AND set state)
- Rendering and Conditional rendering of data from an object or array using `v-for`
- Use Computed properties to create derived state from existing values
- Bind basic mouse events using `v-on` or `@`
- Two-way binding form inputs with `v-model`

## Todo list
